# Kapeta Readme
This file contains some structural information about this service.

This file will be overwritten every time you change the service definition in Kapeta.

## Folder Structure
This service is structured as follows:

### Generated files
All files in the following folders are generated by Kapeta - and should not be edited manually.
* ```src/.generated/config```: Contains your configuration entities
* ```src/.generated/data```: Contains anything related to databases
* ```src/.generated/entities```: Contains the public entities used by the service.

### Editable files
All other files are editable - and will not be overwritten by Kapeta unless explictly mentioned in the file.

* ```src/service```: Contains the service layer logic. This is where you should add your business logic

### Path alias for generated files

To import generated files you can use the following path alias:
```typescript
import { MyEntity } from 'generated:entities/MyEntity';
```




## RabbitMQ Publisher
To publish messages to the RabbitMQ queue a publisher is generated for you for each resource.

Use the constructor function to create a new publisher.

Below is an example of how to use the publisher to publish a message to one or more exchanges:
```javascript
import { ConfigProvider } from '@kapeta/sdk-config';
import { createEventsPublisher } from 'generated:queues/events-publisher';

const configProvider = null; // Get this from somewhere

const eventsPublisher = await createEventsPublisher(configProvider);

await eventsPublisher.publish({
    data: { ... },
});
```
